# Computer Vision Project

For this project which I did with my teammate, [Mohammad Osoolian](https://github.com/mohammad-osoolian), we had to read an image of ID/Credit Card and
perform the following steps:
1. Cut the region of the card in the image
2. Identifying the type of card (ID or Credit)
3. Recognizing the region of numbers on the card
4. Predict the recognized numbers

One of our challenges was the dataset; so, we create a dataset based on the templates of the credit cards of the following banks:
* Keshavarzi
* Mellat
* Melli
* Refah
* Saderat
* Saman
* Tejarat

and you can have a look at our data creation in [data_creation](https://github.com/MohammadHAbbaspour/CV_Proj/tree/main/data_creation) folder
